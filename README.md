# Forge — Freelancing Platform

A full-stack freelancing marketplace: React + Tailwind frontend, Node/Express
backend with JWT auth and Stripe payments, MongoDB (Mongoose) as the primary
database, with an equivalent SQL schema included for MySQL/PostgreSQL.

```
/freelancing-platform
  /frontend   → React app (Tailwind CSS)
  /backend    → Express API (MongoDB via Mongoose)
  /database   → schema.sql + MongoDB schema reference
```

## 1. Run the frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start        # http://localhost:3000
```

The app reads the API base URL from `REACT_APP_API_URL` (defaults to
`http://localhost:5000/api`). Create `frontend/.env` to override it:

```
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

Every page works standalone with sample data even if the backend isn't
running yet (see `pages/Jobs.js`), so you can preview the UI immediately.

## 2. Run the backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env    # then fill in MONGO_URI, JWT_SECRET, STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
npm run dev              # http://localhost:5000, requires nodemon (npm install -D nodemon)
# or: npm start
```

Requires a running MongoDB instance — either local (`mongodb://localhost:27017`)
or a free MongoDB Atlas cluster (recommended, see step 4).

### Key endpoints

| Method | Route | Auth | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/auth/signup` | — | Create account (client or freelancer) |
| POST | `/api/auth/login` | — | Log in, returns JWT |
| GET | `/api/jobs` | — | List/search jobs |
| POST | `/api/jobs` | client | Post a job |
| POST | `/api/proposals` | freelancer | Submit a bid on a job |
| PUT | `/api/proposals/:id/status` | client | Accept/reject a bid |
| POST | `/api/messages` | logged in | Message the other party on a job |
| POST | `/api/reviews` | logged in | Leave a rating after job completion |
| POST | `/api/payments/create-intent` | client | Create a Stripe PaymentIntent for a job |

Full request bodies and validation rules are in `backend/routes/*.js`.

## 3. Set up the database

**MongoDB (used by the backend as-is):**
Models are in `backend/models/`. No manual migration needed — Mongoose
creates collections and indexes automatically on first write. See
`database/mongodb-schema-reference.md` for how the collections relate.

**SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL alternative):**
Run `database/schema.sql` against your database if you'd rather build the
API on a relational store instead of MongoDB. It mirrors the same entities
and relationships.

## 4. Connect frontend ⇄ backend ⇄ database

1. **Database** — create a free cluster at [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas),
   grab the connection string, and put it in `backend/.env` as `MONGO_URI`.
2. **Backend** — `npm run dev` inside `/backend`. Confirm it's up at
   `http://localhost:5000/api/health`.
3. **Frontend** — `npm start` inside `/frontend`. It calls the backend via
   `src/api/client.js`, which attaches the JWT from `localStorage` to every
   request automatically after login/signup.
4. **Auth flow** — Signup/Login pages POST to `/api/auth/signup` or
   `/api/auth/login` → backend returns `{ user, token }` → frontend stores
   both via `AuthContext` (`src/context/AuthContext.js`) → token is sent as
   `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on subsequent requests.

## 5. Payments (Stripe)

1. Create a Stripe account and grab your **secret key** (test mode) from the
   Stripe dashboard → put it in `backend/.env` as `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`.
2. Backend exposes `POST /api/payments/create-intent`, which creates a
   PaymentIntent for a job's budget and returns a `clientSecret`.
3. On the frontend, use `@stripe/stripe-js` + `@stripe/react-stripe-js`
   (not scaffolded here — add via `npm install @stripe/stripe-js
   @stripe/react-stripe-js`) to mount a payment form with that
   `clientSecret` and confirm the card payment.
4. Stripe confirms success/failure asynchronously via webhook —
   `POST /api/payments/webhook` is already wired up in `server.js` to update
   the `Payment` record's status. Point your Stripe webhook endpoint at
   `https://<your-backend-domain>/api/payments/webhook` and set the signing
   secret if you want to verify signatures (not yet enforced in the sample
   code — add `stripe.webhooks.constructEvent` in `paymentController.js`
   before going to production).

## 6. Testing

- Import the routes above into Postman and test each one with a real JWT
  from `/api/auth/login`.
- Run frontend (`npm start`) and backend (`npm run dev`) side by side and
  click through: signup → post a job → browse jobs → submit a proposal.

## 7. Deployment

| Piece | Suggested host |
|---|---|
| Frontend | Vercel or Netlify — `npm run build` then deploy `/frontend/build` |
| Backend | Render, Railway, or Heroku — deploy `/backend` as a Node service |
| Database | MongoDB Atlas (managed) |

After deploying, update:
- `frontend/.env` → `REACT_APP_API_URL` to your live backend URL
- `backend/.env` → `CLIENT_URL` to your live frontend URL (used for CORS)
- Stripe dashboard → webhook endpoint to your live backend URL

## 8. Scaling ideas (not implemented, noted for future work)

- **Caching** — Redis for hot job listings and session/rate-limit data.
- **Logging** — Winston (or pino) with structured JSON logs shipped to a
  log aggregator.
- **Analytics** — a dashboard aggregating job volume, proposal acceptance
  rate, and payment totals per client/freelancer.
- **Real-time messaging** — swap the polling-based `/api/messages` GET for
  a WebSocket (Socket.IO) layer if you need live chat instead of
  request/refresh.
